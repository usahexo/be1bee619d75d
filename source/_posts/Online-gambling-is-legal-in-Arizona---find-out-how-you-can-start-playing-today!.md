#  Arizona is the latest US state to legalize online gambling!

On Tuesday, the Arizona Senate voted to legalize online gambling, following in the footsteps of states like Nevada and New Jersey.

Governor Doug Ducey is expected to sign the legislation into law, making online gambling legal in Arizona starting in 2020.

The new law will allow players over 21 years of age to gamble on casino games, poker, and sports betting websites from their computers or mobile devices.

Players will be able to deposit money into their accounts and withdraw winnings directly to their bank accounts. Licensing and regulatory fees will be collected by the state Department of Gaming.

The Arizona Senate initially passed a measure legalizing online gambling in February, but that bill was vetoed by Governor Ducey. The new bill is narrower in scope and does not include provisions allowing tribal casinos to offer online gaming.

Governor Ducey has said that he supports the legalization of online gambling but wants to make sure that it is properly regulated and that players are protected from fraud and abuse.
