How to Play Roulette

Roulette is a simple game to play - all you need is a wheel with numbered slots and a ball. The wheel is spun and the ball is dropped into one of the slots. The goal is to guess which number the ball will land on.

There are 38 numbers on a European roulette wheel - from 0 to 36. You can bet on any single number, or on a range of numbers. There are also other betting options available, such as betting on whether the ball will land in black or red, odd or even, or high (19-36) or low (1-18) numbers.

To place a bet, you first need to choose your bet type and then select the number(s) you want to bet on. Some casinos allow you to place bets via an on-screen menu, while others require that you place chips directly on the table.

Once all players have placed their bets, the croupier will spin the wheel and drop the ball into one of the slots. The winner is the player who correctly guessed which number the ball would fall into. If no one guesses correctly, then the pot is divided among all winning players equally.
