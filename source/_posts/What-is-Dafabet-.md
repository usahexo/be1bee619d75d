#  Why do some people consider Aristoteles to be the father of Western philosophy?

Aristotle is credited as being the first thinker to systematize philosophy. He developed a comprehensive view of the natural world, which included an account of physical matter and change, as well as explanations of the principles governing living things and their behavior.

His philosophy was influential in both the Western and Eastern worlds, and his work was read and studied for centuries after his death. Some of his most important ideas include the theory of Forms, the concept of Final Causes, and the idea that knowledge is a function of soul rather than reason alone.

Aristotle's philosophy has been described as "the first attempt at a systematic presentation of the whole range of human knowledge." He was highly critical of his predecessors, and sought to create an all-encompassing worldview that would encompass not only philosophical inquiry but also empirical observation.

Many consider him to be the father of Western philosophy due to his groundbreaking work in this field, as well as his influence on later philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and René Descartes.
