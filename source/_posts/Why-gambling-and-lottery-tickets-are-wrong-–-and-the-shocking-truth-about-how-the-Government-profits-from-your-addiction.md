#  Why gambling and lottery tickets are wrong – and the shocking truth about how the Government profits from your addiction

Gambling is one of the most insidious and harmful addictions in society. It ruins lives, breaks up families, and costs millions in lost productivity and social services. What’s even worse is that governments actually benefit from gambling addiction!

Let’s start with the basics: Gambling is when you risk something of value – usually money, but it can also be possessions or even your reputation – in the hopes of winning more than you lose. There are many different types of gambling, but they all have one thing in common: they are a tax on stupidity.

Seriously, ask any mathematician or statistician and they will tell you that the odds of winning at gambling are so astronomically against you that it’s not even funny. For example, if you were to bet $1 on a coin flip, your odds of winning would be 50/50… but if you played that game 100 times, you would only win about $47 – meaning you would lose $53 in total! And that’s not even taking into account things like blackjack or roulette where the odds are even worse!

So why do people gamble? The answer is simple: greed and hope. People gamble because they want to get rich quick. They hope to win big and make all their money problems go away. But as we’ve already seen, this almost never happens. In fact, the vast majority of people who gamble lose money in the long run.

And yet governments continue to promote gambling. Why? Because it’s a huge source of revenue for them! In countries like Canada and the United States, gambling brings in billions of dollars in taxes every year. This money goes towards funding everything from roads to schools to war efforts. So while gambling may be bad for individual addicts, it’s great for governments!

But what about lotteries? Aren’t they harmless? Lotteries are often sold as a way for regular people to become millionaires overnight. But as we’ve already seen, the odds of winning a lottery are minuscule. In fact, you’re more likely to die from a lightning strike than win the lottery! So why do people buy tickets? Again, it comes down to greed and hope. People think that their luck will change and they will finally hit the jackpot. But as we know, this almost never happens.

So what can we do to stop people from gambling and buying lottery tickets? The answer is education. We need to educate people about the dangers of gambling and how it can ruin their lives. We also need to make sure they understand just how much money governments actually make from gambling addiction. Only then will people be less likely to fall prey to these schemes

#  The addictive power of internet casino gambling: why it's so hard to quit

It's no secret that internet casino gambling can be addictive. But why is it so hard to quit?

For starters, internet casino gambling provides a dopamine rush that's hard to beat. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in pleasure and reward, and it's released when we do things that make us feel good, such as eating tasty food, having sex or winning money.

The problem is that the dopamine rush from internet casino gambling can be just as strong as the dopamine rush from other activities that are healthy and rewarding. So it's no wonder that people can find it so hard to quit.

 Additionally, online casinos are constantly bombarding players with messages designed to keep them hooked. For example, they might offer tempting bonuses or discounts on future bets, or they might send emails containing stories of people who have won big jackpots.

These messages can be very effective at keeping players engaged and entangled in the web of addiction. And once someone is addicted, it can be extremely difficult to break free.

That's because addiction is a mental condition characterized by compulsive behaviour and an inability to control urges. In other words, addiction causes people to act in ways that are contrary to their own best interests.

And for someone who is addicted to internet casino gambling, quitting may seem like an impossible task. That's because the addiction has taken control of their life, and they are no longer able to make rational decisions about their behaviour.

So if you're struggling with an addiction to internet casino gambling, don't despair – there is help available. There are many excellent rehab centres staffed by experienced professionals who can help you get your life back on track.

#  How 'loot boxes' in video games became a $30 billion industry

Loot boxes, it seems, are everywhere.

The randomized in-game reward system has exploded in popularity in the last few years, but its exact origins are difficult to mark. They could be traced back to massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) like World of Warcraft and Eve Online, where rare virtual goodies could be bought with real money. From there, they began popping up in mobile games and other free-to-play titles.

But it was when they started appearing in big-budget AAA console and PC games that things started to get really interesting - and lucrative.

In a move that was both criticized and applauded by gamers and industry watchers alike, EA's Star Wars Battlefront II included loot boxes as a way of earning credits to unlock new characters, weapons, and other upgrades. The issue? Players could spend hours grinding away at the game only to find that they didn't have enough credits to buy the thing they wanted most. So they could either spend more time playing - or open their wallets.

EA eventually backed down in the face of overwhelming public criticism and removed microtransactions from the game shortly before it was released. But the whole incident shone a light on an aspect of the gaming industry that had been growing quietly behind the scenes for years: loot boxes are big business.

And business is booming. A report by market research firm SuperData Research estimated that loot boxes brought in more than $30 billion in revenue last year. That's more than twice what Hollywood made from ticket sales in 2017.

So what's fueling this massive growth? There are a few factors at work here.

For starters, as mentioned earlier, loot boxes have become an incredibly effective way of monetizing free-to-play games - which now account for the majority of mobile app downloads. Not only do they keep players engaged with the game (the desire to get better rewards drives people to keep playing), but they also encourage them to spend real money onoptional extras.

Secondly, while there have been occasions where gamers have revolted against developers over perceived greediness (Battlefront II is a good example), for the most part they seem happy to pay for loot boxes as long as the games remain reasonably priced. In fact, many see buying loot boxes as a form of investment - not just in terms of what extra content they might receive, but also because it helps support their favorite developers or publishers.


Loot boxes aren't going away anytime soon - in fact, their popularity is only going to continue growing. So if you're someone who enjoys playing video games, it's worth getting used to the idea of opening them up every now and then...especially if you're hoping for some cool new gear

#  Is loot-based monetization turning video games into casinos?

The video game industry has made a fortune in recent years by turning to loot boxes as a form of monetization. These are items that can be bought with real-world money and give players an advantage in the game. While they can be earned through play, it’s often very difficult to do so, which has led to criticism that they’re a form of gambling.

Now casino games publishers have cottoned on to the potential for loot boxes and are looking to bring the same model to their products. This is likely to lead to further criticism of the video game industry, with some saying that it’s turning video games into casinos.

There is no doubt that loot boxes are lucrative for publishers. They provide a steady stream of income that helps ensure a game’s profitability over time. However, they also come with a lot of baggage. The fact that they can be seen as a form of gambling has led to criticism from many quarters.

Now casino games publishers are looking to take advantage of this by bringing loot boxes into their products. This is likely to lead to even more controversy, with some accusing the video game industry of turning video games into casinos.

Whether this is a good or bad thing is up for debate. On one hand, it could be seen as a negative development, as it could lead to more people becoming addicted to gambling. On the other hand, it could be seen as a positive development, as it could help people learn how to gamble responsibly.

What is clear is that this trend is likely to continue in the coming years. Publishers will continue to look for new ways to make money from their games and will turn to loot boxes as a way of doing so. This means that we can expect more controversy over this issue in the future.
