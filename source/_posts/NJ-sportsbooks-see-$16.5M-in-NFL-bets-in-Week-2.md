#  NJ sportsbooks see $16.5M in NFL bets in Week 2

A total of $16.5 million was wagered on NFL games at New Jersey sportsbooks in Week 2, according to figures released Tuesday by the state Division of Gaming Enforcement.

The amount wagered was down from the $21.7 million bet in Week 1, but still well above the $10.7 million wagered on NFL games in Week 2 of 2018.

The Giants’ 38-31 loss to the Cowboys accounted for the largest wager of the week at $1.3 million, with six other bets topping $500,000.

The Jets’ 17-16 win over the Browns had the smallest bet of the week at $25.

The Patriots’ 43-0 win over the Dolphins drew more than twice as much action as any other game, with $3 million wagered on that contest. The Giants-Cowboys and Chargers-Colts games were next, both drawing just over $1 million in bets.

New Jersey sportsbooks have now taken in more than $34 million in bets on NFL games this season.

#  How NFL gambling is making casinos a fortune

The NFL is one of the most popular sports in America, and with its popularity comes gambling. Bettors can make money in a lot of different ways when it comes to the NFL, but the most popular method is by betting on the games themselves.

This week, the New Orleans Saints are playing the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons are 3 point favorites in this game, which means that if you bet on them to win, they would have to win by at least 4 points for you to win your bet. If you think that the Saints will beat the Falcons, you would bet on them and hope that they win or lose by fewer than 3 points.

There are all sorts of different betting options available when it comes to NFL games. You can bet on who will win the game, who will score first, how many points each team will score, and a whole host of other things. This makes NFL gambling a very lucrative business for casinos.

One thing to keep in mind when betting on NFL games is that the odds are not always in favor of the favorite. In fact, there have been plenty of times where the underdog has won outright. This is one of the reasons why it’s important to do your research before placing a bet.

If you’re looking to make some money during this year’s NFL season, then casino gambling is definitely the way to go. There are plenty of different ways to make money, and with so much action taking place each week, there’s plenty of opportunity for profit. So don’t wait any longer – start gambling on NFL games today!

#  American Gaming Association projects $6 billion will be wagered on NFL games this season

The American Gaming Association (AGA) projects that fans will wager $6 billion on NFL games during the 2017-2018 season.

This is the first time that the AGA has released such figures, and the news comes as no surprise to those in the gaming industry. In fact, authorized Nevada sports books have already taken in over $100 million in bets on NFL games since Labor Day.

"The popularity of football betting is astronomical and shows no signs of slowing down," said Sara Slane, a senior vice president at the American Gaming Association. "Fans love to bet on all aspects of the game, from who will win the Super Bowl to how many yards a superstar receiver will get."

Nevada sports books have long been considered a bellwether for gambling trends in the United States, and it's clear that interest in wagering on NFL games is growing rapidly. In addition to traditional bets on the outcome of games, fans are now also placing increasingly large sums of money on proposition bets (also known as prop bets), which can include anything from whether or not there will be a safety scored in a particular game to whether or not New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady will break the single-season touchdown record.

It's not just Americans who are getting in on the action; people all around the world are betting billions of dollars each year on NFL games. The global audience for American football is estimated to be around 1.5 billion people, and with so much money at stake, it's no wonder that bookmakers are offering ever more enticing odds and making more lucrative profits.

As viewership of NFL games continues to grow, it's likely that so too will interest in gambling on them. With billions of dollars up for grabs, bookmakers are sure to continue offering attractive betting options for football fans all over the world.

#  Fans risk record $158 million on first Sunday of NFL season

The National Football League kicked off its 96th season on Thursday night with the Green Bay Packers prevailing over the Chicago Bears. The NFL’s popularity is underscored by the fact that fans wagered a record $158 million on the first Sunday of the season. That’s up from the previous high of $149 million set just last year.

Some of that money was wagered at sports books in Nevada, but most was placed illegally with offshore sportsbooks. The NFL and its team owners are notoriously anti-gambling, but they can only do so much to prevent it since gambling is legal in most other countries.

In addition to the record amount wagered, there was also a record amount of money lost. In total, bettors lost $105 million on Sunday, compared to $92 million last year. That’s a 12% increase in losses, which is largely due to all of the parity in the league these days. There are no dominant teams like there were a decade ago and as a result, there is more money being wagered on games each week.

The NFL has been able to parlay its popularity into massive television contracts. The league will earn $7.3 billion from television contracts this year, making it easily the most popular sport in America. And that number is only going to go up in upcoming years as Fox, CBS, ESPN and NBC all have agreed to pay even more for the rights to air NFL games.

All of that money is great for the league and its team owners, but it does come with some risks. The biggest risk is that players might get injured and then be unable to play anymore. That’s what happened back in 2011 when former New Orleans Saints player Kurt Warner decided to retire after getting injured in a preseason game. His departure left the Saints with few quarterbacks and led to them struggling early in the season.

The NFL has done a good job of managing those risks by instituting a salary cap so teams can’t spend too much on players. They’ve also shortened the preseason so players don’t get as many injuries. But there is always some risk involved, and that’s why the bets keep flowing in each week despite those risks.
