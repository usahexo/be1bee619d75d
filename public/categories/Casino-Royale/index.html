The casino has around 80 table games and 1,600 slot machines.</p>
<p>The Choctaw Casino is not as big as the WinStar World Casino and Resort or the Chickasaw National Recreation Area, but it is still a popular spot for those who live in the area. The casino offers a variety of gaming options, including blackjack, poker, craps, and roulette.</p>
<p>There are also a number of different slot machines available, including traditional slots and progressive slots. There are also some specialty games available, such as bingo and keno.</p>

<h1 id="1-5Billion-Expansion-Unveiled-at-Choctaw-Casino-XIYOUJI-Game"><a href="#1-5Billion-Expansion-Unveiled-at-Choctaw-Casino-XIYOUJI-Game" class="headerlink" title="$1.5Billion Expansion Unveiled at Choctaw Casino XIYOUJI Game"></a>$1.5Billion Expansion Unveiled at Choctaw Casino XIYOUJI Game</h1><p>On November 9, 2017, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma announced a $1.5 billion expansion project for its Choctaw Casino &amp; Resort in Durant. The expansion will include a new 50,000-square-foot gaming floor with 1,050 new games, including an Asian gaming area called XIYOUJI (translated as “enjoy your game”). It will also include a new 15-story 300-room hotel, expanded dining options, and additional meeting and event space.</p>
<p>This is the second major expansion project for the Choctaw Casino Resort in the past three years; the first was a $465 million project that opened in late 2015 and added a new 875-room hotel, 20 restaurants and bars, and other amenities. The tribe says that the new gaming area will be its most luxurious ever, with VIP lounges and private gaming areas.</p>
<p>The Choctaw Nation has been one of the most successful tribes in terms of gambling revenue. The casino resort alone has generated over $2.5 billion in gambling revenue since it opened in 2006. This latest expansion is part of an effort by the tribe to keep up with growing competition from other casinos in the region, such as those in Dallas and Tulsa.</p>
<p>In addition to the new gaming floor, hotel, and dining options, the expansion will also include a new golf course designed by Tom Fazio. The tribe says that it is investing in this expansion to create more jobs and economic development opportunities for its members.</p>

<p>“Oklahoma is my most important place because it’s where I was born and raised. It’s also home to one of the largest Native American populations in the country, so it holds a special place in my heart,” said XIYOUJI Game.</p>
<p>This sentiment is echoed by many other Oklahomans, who are proud of their state’s rich culture and history. And with attractions like Choctaw Casino Resort drawing tourists from all over the world, Oklahoma is quickly becoming a destination hotspot.</p>
