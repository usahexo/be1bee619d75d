<li><p>Make the game more challenging by giving students harder questions or facts to find on their cards.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Play a timed version of the game where students have a certain amount of time to win by getting five in a row.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split the class into teams and see which team can get five in a row first.</p>

<li>Play for higher stakes</li>

<ol start="4">
