<h1 id="Who-was-Aristoteles"><a href="#Who-was-Aristoteles" class="headerlink" title="Who was Aristoteles?"></a>Who was Aristoteles?</h1><p>Aristoteles was born in 384 BC at Stagira, Chalkidike, Greece. He was a Greek philosopher and scientist and one of the greatest minds of the ancient world. </p>
<p>He was the son of Nichomachus, a physician to King Amyntas of Macedon. After his father’s death, he became the pupil of Plato in Athens. When Plato died in 347 BC, Aristoteles left Athens and spent twenty years (335-314 BC) traveling throughout Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt. </p>
<p>In 335 BC he returned to Athens and founded his own school, the Lyceum. There he lectured on philosophy and science for over twenty years. He died in 322 BC. </p>
<p>Aristotle was one of the most influential philosophers in history. His philosophical works covered almost every area of knowledge then available. In particular, he developed systematic treatments on logic, metaphysics, ethics, politics, esthetics, and science. </p>
<p>Aristotle’s philosophy is still studied and debated by philosophers to this day</p>

(aka Spurs) has won two titles. The first in 2001–02 and the second in 2008-09. They also finished runner-up in 2006-07 and 2017-18. </p>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur was founded in 1882 as Hotspur Football Club by schoolboys from Charterhouse School. They were initially based at Northumberland Park and played their first competitive match in October 1884 against Harrow School. In 1886, they moved to Tottenham Marshes and then to White Hart Lane in 1899.</p>
<p>The club’s biggest rivals are Arsenal with whom they contest the North London derby. However, they also have a rivalry with Chelsea, which has developed since the mid-1990s due to a number of high-profile matches between the two sides. </p>
<p>The following players have been awarded the Football Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year while playing for Tottenham Hotspur:<br>Alan Mullery (1964), Martin Chivers (1972), Pat Jennings (1983), Gary Lineker (1986), David Ginola (1999) and Harry Kane (2018).</p>

He developed a comprehensive view of the natural world, which included an account of physical matter and change, as well as explanations of the principles governing living things and their behavior.</p>
<p>His philosophy was influential in both the Western and Eastern worlds, and his work was read and studied for centuries after his death. Some of his most important ideas include the theory of Forms, the concept of Final Causes, and the idea that knowledge is a function of soul rather than reason alone.</p>
<p>Aristotle’s philosophy has been described as “the first attempt at a systematic presentation of the whole range of human knowledge.” He was highly critical of his predecessors, and sought to create an all-encompassing worldview that would encompass not only philosophical inquiry but also empirical observation.</p>
<p>Many consider him to be the father of Western philosophy due to his groundbreaking work in this field, as well as his influence on later philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and René Descartes.</p>
