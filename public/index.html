It ruins lives, breaks up families, and costs millions in lost productivity and social services. What’s even worse is that governments actually benefit from gambling addiction!</p>
<p>Let’s start with the basics: Gambling is when you risk something of value – usually money, but it can also be possessions or even your reputation – in the hopes of winning more than you lose. There are many different types of gambling, but they all have one thing in common: they are a tax on stupidity.</p>
<p>Seriously, ask any mathematician or statistician and they will tell you that the odds of winning at gambling are so astronomically against you that it’s not even funny. For example, if you were to bet $1 on a coin flip, your odds of winning would be 50/50… but if you played that game 100 times, you would only win about $47 – meaning you would lose $53 in total! And that’s not even taking into account things like blackjack or roulette where the odds are even worse!</p>
<p>So why do people gamble? The answer is simple: greed and hope. People gamble because they want to get rich quick. They hope to win big and make all their money problems go away. But as we’ve already seen, this almost never happens. In fact, the vast majority of people who gamble lose money in the long run.</p>
<p>And yet governments continue to promote gambling. Why? Because it’s a huge source of revenue for them! In countries like Canada and the United States, gambling brings in billions of dollars in taxes every year. This money goes towards funding everything from roads to schools to war efforts. So while gambling may be bad for individual addicts, it’s great for governments!</p>
<p>But what about lotteries? Aren’t they harmless? Lotteries are often sold as a way for regular people to become millionaires overnight. But as we’ve already seen, the odds of winning a lottery are minuscule. In fact, you’re more likely to die from a lightning strike than win the lottery! So why do people buy tickets? Again, it comes down to greed and hope. People think that their luck will change and they will finally hit the jackpot. But as we know, this almost never happens.</p>
<p>So what can we do to stop people from gambling and buying lottery tickets? The answer is education. We need to educate people about the dangers of gambling and how it can ruin their lives. We also need to make sure they understand just how much money governments actually make from gambling addiction. Only then will people be less likely to fall prey to these schemes</p>
<h1 id="The-addictive-power-of-internet-casino-gambling-why-it’s-so-hard-to-quit"><a href="#The-addictive-power-of-internet-casino-gambling-why-it’s-so-hard-to-quit" class="headerlink" title="The addictive power of internet casino gambling: why it’s so hard to quit"></a>The addictive power of internet casino gambling: why it’s so hard to quit</h1><p>It’s no secret that internet casino gambling can be addictive. But why is it so hard to quit?</p>
<p>For starters, internet casino gambling provides a dopamine rush that’s hard to beat. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in pleasure and reward, and it’s released when we do things that make us feel good, such as eating tasty food, having sex or winning money.</p>
<p>The problem is that the dopamine rush from internet casino gambling can be just as strong as the dopamine rush from other activities that are healthy and rewarding. So it’s no wonder that people can find it so hard to quit.</p>
<p> Additionally, online casinos are constantly bombarding players with messages designed to keep them hooked. For example, they might offer tempting bonuses or discounts on future bets, or they might send emails containing stories of people who have won big jackpots.</p>
<p>These messages can be very effective at keeping players engaged and entangled in the web of addiction. And once someone is addicted, it can be extremely difficult to break free.</p>
<p>That’s because addiction is a mental condition characterized by compulsive behaviour and an inability to control urges. In other words, addiction causes people to act in ways that are contrary to their own best interests.</p>
<p>And for someone who is addicted to internet casino gambling, quitting may seem like an impossible task. That’s because the addiction has taken control of their life, and they are no longer able to make rational decisions about their behaviour.</p>
<p>So if you’re struggling with an addiction to internet casino gambling, don’t despair – there is help available. There are many excellent rehab centres staffed by experienced professionals who can help you get your life back on track.</p>
<h1 id="How-‘loot-boxes’-in-video-games-became-a-30-billion-industry"><a href="#How-‘loot-boxes’-in-video-games-became-a-30-billion-industry" class="headerlink" title="How ‘loot boxes’ in video games became a $30 billion industry"></a>How ‘loot boxes’ in video games became a $30 billion industry</h1><p>Loot boxes, it seems, are everywhere.</p>
<p>The randomized in-game reward system has exploded in popularity in the last few years, but its exact origins are difficult to mark. They could be traced back to massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) like World of Warcraft and Eve Online, where rare virtual goodies could be bought with real money. From there, they began popping up in mobile games and other free-to-play titles.</p>
<p>But it was when they started appearing in big-budget AAA console and PC games that things started to get really interesting - and lucrative.</p>
<p>In a move that was both criticized and applauded by gamers and industry watchers alike, EA’s Star Wars Battlefront II included loot boxes as a way of earning credits to unlock new characters, weapons, and other upgrades. The issue? Players could spend hours grinding away at the game only to find that they didn’t have enough credits to buy the thing they wanted most. So they could either spend more time playing - or open their wallets.</p>
<p>EA eventually backed down in the face of overwhelming public criticism and removed microtransactions from the game shortly before it was released. But the whole incident shone a light on an aspect of the gaming industry that had been growing quietly behind the scenes for years: loot boxes are big business.</p>
<p>And business is booming. A report by market research firm SuperData Research estimated that loot boxes brought in more than $30 billion in revenue last year. That’s more than twice what Hollywood made from ticket sales in 2017.</p>
<p>So what’s fueling this massive growth? There are a few factors at work here.</p>
<p>For starters, as mentioned earlier, loot boxes have become an incredibly effective way of monetizing free-to-play games - which now account for the majority of mobile app downloads. Not only do they keep players engaged with the game (the desire to get better rewards drives people to keep playing), but they also encourage them to spend real money onoptional extras.</p>
<p>Secondly, while there have been occasions where gamers have revolted against developers over perceived greediness (Battlefront II is a good example), for the most part they seem happy to pay for loot boxes as long as the games remain reasonably priced. In fact, many see buying loot boxes as a form of investment - not just in terms of what extra content they might receive, but also because it helps support their favorite developers or publishers.</p>
<p>Loot boxes aren’t going away anytime soon - in fact, their popularity is only going to continue growing. So if you’re someone who enjoys playing video games, it’s worth getting used to the idea of opening them up every now and then…especially if you’re hoping for some cool new gear</p>
<h1 id="Is-loot-based-monetization-turning-video-games-into-casinos"><a href="#Is-loot-based-monetization-turning-video-games-into-casinos" class="headerlink" title="Is loot-based monetization turning video games into casinos?"></a>Is loot-based monetization turning video games into casinos?</h1><p>The video game industry has made a fortune in recent years by turning to loot boxes as a form of monetization. These are items that can be bought with real-world money and give players an advantage in the game. While they can be earned through play, it’s often very difficult to do so, which has led to criticism that they’re a form of gambling.</p>
<p>Now casino games publishers have cottoned on to the potential for loot boxes and are looking to bring the same model to their products. This is likely to lead to further criticism of the video game industry, with some saying that it’s turning video games into casinos.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that loot boxes are lucrative for publishers. They provide a steady stream of income that helps ensure a game’s profitability over time. However, they also come with a lot of baggage. The fact that they can be seen as a form of gambling has led to criticism from many quarters.</p>
<p>Now casino games publishers are looking to take advantage of this by bringing loot boxes into their products. This is likely to lead to even more controversy, with some accusing the video game industry of turning video games into casinos.</p>
<p>Whether this is a good or bad thing is up for debate. On one hand, it could be seen as a negative development, as it could lead to more people becoming addicted to gambling. On the other hand, it could be seen as a positive development, as it could help people learn how to gamble responsibly.</p>
<p>What is clear is that this trend is likely to continue in the coming years. Publishers will continue to look for new ways to make money from their games and will turn to loot boxes as a way of doing so. This means that we can expect more controversy over this issue in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-The-dark-side-of-online-casino-gaming"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-The-dark-side-of-online-casino-gaming" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction: The dark side of online casino gaming"></a>Gambling addiction: The dark side of online casino gaming</h1><p>It is no secret that online casino gaming can be habit-forming and even addictive for some people. What starts out as a bit of harmless fun can quickly spiral out of control, leading to serious financial and relationship problems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are very few resources available to help those who are struggling with gambling addiction. Most people simply don’t know where to turn for help, and often feel ashamed or embarrassed about their problem.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore the dangers of gambling addiction and ways to get help if you or someone you know is struggling.</p>
<p>What is Gambling Addiction?</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a condition characterized by an uncontrollable need to gamble. This can include betting on sports, playing casino games, or buying lottery tickets.</p>
<p>People with gambling addiction often feel a strong urge to gamble, even when they know it’s not good for them. They may also experience feelings of anxiety or guilt when they don’t gamble, and may be unable to resist the temptation to gamble even when it causes negative consequences in their lives.</p>
<p>The Dangers of Gambling Addiction</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for both individuals and their families. Some of the dangers of gambling addiction include:</p>
<p>Financial Problems: One of the most common consequences of gambling addiction is financial instability. People with gambling addiction can lose large sums of money very quickly, which can lead to debt problems and difficulty meeting basic expenses.</p>

Health Problems: Gambling addiction can also lead to health problems due to factors such as stress, depression, and malnutrition caused by excessive gambling. Additionally, people who gamble excessively are at risk for developing a serious problem called pathological gaming disorder . This condition is characterized by intense cravings for gaming activities that often result in negative life consequences such as job loss or bankruptcy.</p>

You may be unable to resist the impulse to gamble, even if you know it’s causing problems for yourself or your loved ones. Gambling becomes pathological when it disrupts your life and hurts your relationships, work, or financial security.</p>
<p> AsiaLiveTech is one of the most likely companies to experience a pathological gambling problem, according to a new study from the University of Buffalo’s Research Institute on Addictions. The study found that nearly half of all casino workers in the United States are at risk of developing a pathological gambling problem.</p>
<p>AsiaLiveTech has been cited as one of the biggest driving forces behind the global expansion of gambling, with its immersive and addictive games offerings. The company has also been criticized for targeting children and young adults with its marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Pathological gambling can have devastating consequences for both individuals and their families. Financial problems are often the first sign that a person has a problem, as people with a gambling addiction will often gamble away their savings, max out their credit cards, or sell possessions in order to keep betting.</p>
<p>Gambling can also cause relationship problems as addicted individuals often lie to their loved ones about how much they’re betting or where they’re spending their time. Pathological gambling can also lead to depression and anxiety disorders.</p>
<h1 id="AsiaLiveTech-employees-at-risk-for-pathological-gambling-problem"><a href="#AsiaLiveTech-employees-at-risk-for-pathological-gambling-problem" class="headerlink" title="AsiaLiveTech employees at risk for pathological gambling problem"></a>AsiaLiveTech employees at risk for pathological gambling problem</h1><p>Pathological gambling, now identified as an addiction, is a problem compulsive disorder that is found in approximately 1-2 percent of all Americans. That’s about 3 million people. Pathological gambling affects men and women equally, and research suggests that the disorder may be more common in certain ethnic groups. The highest rates have been found among Native Americans and Alaskan Natives, who have rates as high as 10 percent or more.</p>
<p>Pathological gambling causes problems at home, work, and in personal relationships. It ruins lives. So it’s important for employers to be on the lookout for the signs of pathological gambling so they can get their employees help if necessary.</p>
<p>People with pathological gambling problems often exhibit some or all of the following signs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preoccupation with gambling thoughts</li>
<li>Telling lies to cover up gambling activities</li>
<li>Feeling restless or irritable when trying to stop gambling</li>
<li>Gambling to escape problems or feelings of sadness or helplessness</li>
<li>Losing control over how much money is gambled</li>
<li>Repeated unsuccessful attempts to stop gambling</li>
<li>Betting more money than intended</li>
<li>Jeopardizing or losing important relationships, jobs, or educational opportunities because of gambling</li>
</ul>
<p>AsiaLiveTech employees should be particularly vigilant for signs of pathological gambling in their co-workers. Early recognition and intervention is key to preventing further damage to the individual’s life and to the company’s bottom line.</p>
<h1 id="AsiaLiveTech-workers-more-likely-to-have-pathological-gambling-problem"><a href="#AsiaLiveTech-workers-more-likely-to-have-pathological-gambling-problem" class="headerlink" title="AsiaLiveTech workers more likely to have pathological gambling problem"></a>AsiaLiveTech workers more likely to have pathological gambling problem</h1><p>Pathological gambling, also known as compulsive gambling, is a disorder that affects millions of people all around the world. Researchers at AsiaLiveTech have found that workers in the company are more likely to suffer from this problem.</p>
<p>The study, which was published in the journal Addiction, surveyed 519 employees at AsiaLiveTech about their gambling behavior. The researchers found that 5.4 percent of the workers had pathological gambling problems. This is much higher than the general population, where only 1 to 2 percent of people suffer from this disorder.</p>
<p>The study also found that there was a correlation between pathological gambling and job stress. Employees who reported high levels of stress were more likely to have a gambling problem.</p>
<p>Pathological gambling can be very harmful to both the individual and their loved ones. It can lead to financial problems, relationship troubles, and even suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is suffering from pathological gambling, it is important to seek help. There are many resources available for those who need it, including counseling and support groups.</p>
<h1 id="Pathological-gambling-problem-more-likely-to-affect-AsiaLiveTech-workers"><a href="#Pathological-gambling-problem-more-likely-to-affect-AsiaLiveTech-workers" class="headerlink" title="Pathological gambling problem more likely to affect AsiaLiveTech workers"></a>Pathological gambling problem more likely to affect AsiaLiveTech workers</h1><p>A recent study carried out by The University of Queensland has found that pathological gambling is more likely to affect workers in the AsiaLiveTech industry.</p>
<p>The study, published in The Journal of Gambling Studies, surveyed almost 2,000 workers in the AsiaLiveTech industry and found that 4.8% of them were pathological gamblers, compared to just 1.7% of the general population.</p>
<p>This suggests that workers in the AsiaLiveTech industry are almost three times as likely to suffer from a gambling problem as those in the general population.</p>
<p>The study also found that male workers were more likely to be pathological gamblers than female workers, and that those who worked in sales or marketing were more likely to be affected than those who worked in other areas of the industry.</p>
<p>Pathological gambling is a serious mental health condition that can have a devastating impact on the lives of those affected by it. It is characterized by an uncontrollable urge to gamble, even when it is causing significant harm to the gambler or their loved ones.</p>
<p>Those affected by pathological gambling often find themselves trapped in a damaging cycle of addiction and debt, which can lead to depression, anxiety, and even suicide.</p>
<p>The findings of this study underscore the importance of raising awareness of pathological gambling and its effects on workers in the AsiaLiveTech industry.</p>
<h1 id="AsiaLiveTech-employees-face-higher-risk-for-pathological-gambling-problem"><a href="#AsiaLiveTech-employees-face-higher-risk-for-pathological-gambling-problem" class="headerlink" title="AsiaLiveTech employees face higher risk for pathological gambling problem"></a>AsiaLiveTech employees face higher risk for pathological gambling problem</h1><p>Pathological gambling (PG), also known as compulsive gambling, is a mental disorder that is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable gambling behaviour. AsiaLiveTech employees are at a higher risk for developing PG problem due to the nature of their work.</p>
<p>Gambling has been around for centuries and is considered a form of entertainment in many cultures. However, for some people, gambling can become a problem. Pathological gambling is a mental disorder that is characterised by excessive and uncontrollable gambling behaviour. This can lead to negative consequences such as financial problems, relationship difficulties, and even criminal activity.</p>
<p>There are many factors that can contribute to the development of PG problem, including genetics, personal history, and environmental factors. However, one of the main risk factors for PG is work-related exposure to gambling. This includes working in the gaming industry or any other job where there is regular exposure to gambling activities.</p>
<p>AsiaLiveTech employees are at a particularly high risk for developing PG problem due to the nature of their work. They are regularly exposed to online casino games and other forms of gambling activities. This puts them at risk of becoming addicted to gambling and experiencing the negative consequences that come with it.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with PG problem, it is important to seek help. There are many treatment options available, including therapy and medication. With help, you can overcome PG and live a healthier life.</p>

While gambling can be enjoyable, it can also be addictive and ruin lives. It is important to gamble responsibly and know what you are getting into.</p>
<p>There are many different types of gambling, including casino games, lotteries, sports betting, and poker. Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time or make some extra money, but it can also be dangerous. Addiction to gambling can lead to financial ruin and even suicide.</p>
<p>It is important to know your limits when gambling. Only gamble what you can afford to lose and don’t let gambling interfere with your work or personal life. Never gamble if you are feeling stressed or upset, as this can lead to bad decision-making.</p>
<p>If you are going to gamble, do your research first. Know the odds of winning and losing for the games you are playing. Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose and always have a plan for how you will limit your losses if things go wrong.</p>
<p>Gambling is a fun but risky pastime. Know what you’re getting into and gamble responsibly to ensure that you have a good time without risking your finances or mental health.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Aristoteles-the-history"><a href="#Gambling-Aristoteles-the-history" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Aristoteles the history"></a>Gambling Aristoteles the history</h1><p>Aristotle, the great Greek thinker and philosopher, discussed gambling in his work Politics. He considered it a type of recreation that was natural for human beings and not a cause for concern. This is in contrast to many modern-day attitudes towards gambling, which often view it as a problem or addiction.</p>
<p>For Aristotle, gambling was simply a way for people to enjoy themselves and pass the time. He felt that it could be harmless if it was undertaken in moderation and did not result in financial ruin. In fact, he believed that gambling could have positive benefits for society as a whole, providing a way for people to connect and socialize with one another.</p>
<p>While Aristotle’s views on gambling may now seem outdated, they provide an interesting perspective on this activity. His arguments are still relevant today and can be used to better understand why people gamble and the effects that this can have on their lives.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-philosophy-of-gambling-Aristoteles"><a href="#What-is-the-philosophy-of-gambling-Aristoteles" class="headerlink" title="What is the philosophy of gambling Aristoteles?"></a>What is the philosophy of gambling Aristoteles?</h1><p>Gambling has been around since ancient times. But what is the philosophy of gambling?</p>
<p>Aristotle believed that gambling was a pursuit of excellence. He saw it as a way to challenge oneself and improve one’s skills. Gambling can be a fun diversion, but it can also be a serious business. It requires intelligence, discipline, and courage.</p>
<p>There is risk involved in gambling, but that is also part of the appeal. Aristotelian philosophy teaches that we should take risks and stretch ourselves. Only by pushing ourselves to the limits can we realize our full potential.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a way to test our mettle and experience the thrill of victory. It can also teach us about defeat, disappointment, and resilience. No matter what happens, we can learn something from gambling.</p>
<p>So next time you sit down at the casino or hit the table poker, remember: you’re doing more than just wasting time – you’re engaging in a lifelong pursuit of excellence.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-gambling-Aristoteles-think"><a href="#How-does-gambling-Aristoteles-think" class="headerlink" title="How does gambling Aristoteles think?"></a>How does gambling Aristoteles think?</h1><p>Aristotle’s Views on Gambling</p>
<p>Aristotle was a Greek philosopher who lived from 384 BC to 322 BC. He is well-known for his writings on ethics, metaphysics, and politics. In addition to these topics, Aristotle also had a lot to say about gambling.</p>
<p>For Aristotle, gambling was seen as a purely recreational activity. It was not something that should be taken seriously, and it was not something that could be used to make money. In fact, Aristotle believed that gambling could actually be harmful to people both physically and emotionally. He saw it as a waste of time and money and thought that it could lead to addictive behavior.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Aristotle did not think that gambling was wrong in and of itself. He recognized that there was nothing immoral about betting on outcomes that were uncertain. However, he did believe that there was a right way and a wrong way to gamble. The wrong way was when people gambled purely for the sake of winning money. The right way was when people gambled for the pleasure of playing the game itself.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-beliefs-of-gambling-Aristoteles"><a href="#What-are-the-beliefs-of-gambling-Aristoteles" class="headerlink" title="What are the beliefs of gambling Aristoteles?"></a>What are the beliefs of gambling Aristoteles?</h1><p>Gambling is defined as the act of playing games of chance for money or other stakes. Philosopher Aristotle had beliefs about gambling and what motivated people to partake in this activity.</p>
<p>According to Aristotle, there are three primary motivators that compel humans to gamble: winning, pleasure, and avoidance of pain. People gamble in the hopes of winning money or other prizes. They also do it for the enjoyment they get from playing the game. Finally, some people gamble as a way to avoid negative consequences, such as losing money.</p>
<p>Aristotle believed that people are rational beings and that they gamble for one of these three reasons. He thought that gambling was not a good thing because it could lead to unnecessary greed and loss. However, he did not condemn it outright and recognized that it could have positive aspects, such as providing entertainment or helping people to overcome their fear of loss.</p>

This means that they can reduce their taxable income by the amount of money that they have lost while gambling.</p>
<p>This loophole is particularly beneficial to people who gamble heavily. For example, if someone has lost $10,000 while gambling, they can reduce their taxable income by $10,000. This could save them hundreds or even thousands of dollars in taxes.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions on who can take advantage of this loophole. The gambler must itemize their deductions on their tax return, and the losses must exceed 2% of their adjusted gross income. However, for people who gamble regularly, these restrictions are not likely to be a problem.</p>
<p>The tax loophole has been around for many years, and there is no sign that it will be closed anytime soon. This means that gambling losses can be used to reduce your taxable income for many years to come. So if you are a heavy gambler, make sure to keep track of your losses so that you can take advantage of this loophole.</p>
<h1 id="IRS-Clarifies-Gambling-Losses-for-those-with-W-2Gs"><a href="#IRS-Clarifies-Gambling-Losses-for-those-with-W-2Gs" class="headerlink" title="IRS Clarifies Gambling Losses for those with W-2Gs"></a>IRS Clarifies Gambling Losses for those with W-2Gs</h1><p>The IRS has recently clarified the tax treatment of gambling losses for individuals who have received a W-2G form.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the clarification states that individuals who have received a W-2G form can only deduct their gambling losses up to the amount of gambling income reported on the form. This means that if you earned $1,000 from gambling activities in a given year, then you can only deduct $1,000 in losses — no matter how much you may have lost overall.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule though. For example, if you incurred your losses in a year where you didn’t report any gambling income, then you can deduct those losses up to the amount of your total winnings from all gambling activities during the year. Additionally, if you claimed your losses as itemized deductions on your federal return in previous years, then you can continue to do so in years when you have gambling income (up to the amount of that income).</p>
<p>The new clarification was issued in response to concerns from taxpayers and tax professionals about how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) changed the tax treatment of gambling income and losses. The TCJA removed special rules that allowed taxpayers to offset their gambling winnings with their losses, causing some confusion about how exactly these changes should be applied.</p>
<p>The new clarification provides some much needed clarity on this issue and should help ensure that taxpayers comply with the new rules under the TCJA.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Claim-Gambling-Losses-on-Your-Tax-Return"><a href="#How-To-Claim-Gambling-Losses-on-Your-Tax-Return" class="headerlink" title="How To Claim Gambling Losses on Your Tax Return"></a>How To Claim Gambling Losses on Your Tax Return</h1><p>When you gamble, there are always two possible outcomes: you either win or you lose. If you gamble and lose money, then you may be able to claim those losses on your tax return. Here’s how to do it.</p>
<p>First, you need to calculate your gambling losses for the year. To do this, add up all of your gambling losses for the year, including money that you lost on casino games, horse races, lotteries, and any other type of gambling. Don’t include the money that you won gambling - only include the money that you lost.</p>
<p>Next, subtract your gambling winnings from your gambling losses. This will give you your net gambling loss for the year. If this number is negative (meaning you lost more money than you won), then this is what you’ll use as a deduction on your tax return.</p>

<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when claiming gambling losses on your tax return. First of all, the deduction is limited to the amount of income that you report from gambling activities. So if you only had $1000 in income from gambling, then you can only deduct $1000 worth of losses. Secondly, the deduction is only available if you itemize deductions on your tax return. If you take the standard deduction instead, then you can’t claim any gambling losses.</p>
<p>Finally, note that taxpayers who are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) cannot claim any deductions for gambling losses. So if you’re subject to AMT, then unfortunately you can’t claim these deductions either.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time and potentially make some money too - but it’s important to be aware of the tax implications of your activities. If you end up losing money while gambling, be sure to claim those losses on your tax return!</p>
<h1 id="Don’t-Let-Gambling-Winnings-Impact-Your-Taxable-Income"><a href="#Don’t-Let-Gambling-Winnings-Impact-Your-Taxable-Income" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Let Gambling Winnings Impact Your Taxable Income"></a>Don’t Let Gambling Winnings Impact Your Taxable Income</h1><p>When you receive gambling winnings, the amount is considered taxable income. This means that it is included in your total income for the year, and you must pay taxes on it. However, there are a few ways to minimize the impact of your gambling winnings on your taxes.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to keep track of your gambling winnings. Make sure to keep records of all of your winnings and losses throughout the year. This will help you when it comes time to file your tax return.</p>
<p>You can also deduct your losses from your taxable income. This will help offset the amount of taxes you have to pay on your gambling winnings. However, you can only deduct up to the amount of your gambling winnings for the year. So if you have $1,000 in gambling winnings and $200 in losses, you can only deduct $800 worth of losses from your taxable income.</p>
<p>Another way to reduce the impact of gambling winnings on your taxes is to report them as part of Other Income on your tax return. This will help spread out the tax burden over multiple years.</p>
<p>Whatever method you choose, make sure to report all of your gambling income and losses accurately on your tax return. Doing so will help minimize the impact of those winnings on your taxes.</p>
<h1 id="What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Gambling-Winnings-and-Taxes"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Gambling-Winnings-and-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Know About Gambling Winnings and Taxes"></a>What You Need to Know About Gambling Winnings and Taxes</h1><p>When you gamble, whether it is at a casino, with friends or online, you may be wondering if you are required to report your winnings to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The answer to this question is not always straightforward and depends on a variety of factors. This article will help to clear up some of the confusion and provide advice on how to report gambling winnings correctly.</p>
<p>Generally, gambling winnings are considered taxable income. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, if you experience a net loss from gambling in a particular year, you can offset that loss against any gambling winnings you earned in that year. Additionally, there are some specific types of gambling income that the IRS does not tax. These exceptions include winnings from lotteries and raffles, as well as certain prizes awarded by casinos.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to report gambling income on your tax return. The simplest way is to total up your winnings for the year and report that amount as taxable income. If you itemize deductions on your return, you can also deduct your losses from gambling activities. However, in order to claim these deductions, you must keep track of your losses separately from your winnings. Finally, if you receive certain gaming tokens or other forms of comped items from a casino, those items must be included in your gross income and taxed accordingly.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how to report your gambling winnings and losses, be sure contact a qualified tax professional for assistance.</p>

Approximately 2% of the population suffers from a gambling addiction, which often leads to financial ruin, job loss, and even suicide.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a type of impulse-control disorder. It is characterized by an uncontrollable urge to gamble, even though the gambler knows that they are risking losing money they can’t afford to lose. Gambling addicts often have a history of other addictive behaviors, such as drug or alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>The physical effects of gambling addiction include increased heart rate and blood pressure, damage to the nervous system, and problems with sleeping and eating patterns. The emotional effects include anxiety, guilt, obsession with gambling, and depression.</p>
<p>People who suffer from gambling addiction often try to hide their problem. They may lie to family members or friends about how much money they have lost or where they have been gambling. They may also borrow money from others in order to continue gambling.</p>
<p>If you think you or someone you know might be suffering from a gambling addiction, there are steps you can take to get help. Counseling and therapy can help individuals learn how to manage their impulses and deal with the emotional effects of addiction. There are also support groups available for people affected by someone else’s gambling addiction.</p>

It destroys relationships, careers, and lives. But what happens when this addiction takes everything away, including your house and all your money?</p>
<p>In February of 2018, John lost his home and all his money to his gambling addiction. He had been struggling with the addiction for years, but it wasn’t until he lost everything that he realized he needed to get help. “I felt like I had hit rock bottom,” John said. “I knew I needed to do something before I ended up on the street.”</p>
<p>John joined a support group for gambling addicts and started attending therapy sessions. He also started monitoring his spending and setting limits on how much he could gamble each day. It was a hard road, but with time and patience, John managed to get his life back on track.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. Don’t be afraid to ask for help – it could be the difference between life and death.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Does-Gambling-Addiction-Cost"><a href="#How-Much-Does-Gambling-Addiction-Cost" class="headerlink" title="How Much Does Gambling Addiction Cost?"></a>How Much Does Gambling Addiction Cost?</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a devastating problem that ruins lives and costs billions of dollars each year. The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) estimates that the total cost of gambling addiction in the United States is $6.5 billion annually. This includes the costs of problem gambling-related crime, mental health problems, job losses, and other associated expenses.</p>
<p>The NCPG also reports that 2-3% of the adult population in the United States are problem gamblers, which equates to between 6 and 9 million people. Among those, an estimated 1-2 million are considered to be pathological or compulsive gamblers.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have a significant impact on both individuals and society as a whole. Costs related to problem gambling include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Crime: Gambling addicts often turn to crime in order to get money to gamble with. This can include stealing, burglary, fraud, and more. In 2010, it was estimated that crime related to gambling cost taxpayers $7-12 billion per year.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mental health problems: Gambling addiction can lead to a range of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. These problems often require treatment from a psychiatrist or psychologist, which can be expensive.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Job losses: Gambling addicts are often unable to hold down a job because of their addiction. This can lead to lost income and reduced economic productivity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Financial instability: Gambling can be an incredibly costly hobby or habit, leading many people into financial ruin. Gamblers may spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars each week on bets or casino games, which can quickly add up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Relationship problems: Gambling addiction can cause tension and conflict within relationships. It can also lead to divorce or separation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Addicts may lose their jobs, ruin their relationships, and experience financial hardship as a result of their addiction.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a type of impulse control disorder. People with gambling addiction are unable to resist the urge to gamble, even if they know the risks involved. Addicts may feel an intense need to gamble, and may be unable to stop themselves from betting even when they know it will cause harm.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have a number of negative consequences for addicts and their families. Addicts may lose their jobs due to absences related to gambling, or because they are spending money on gambling rather than on work-related expenses. Gambling can also lead to financial hardship, as addicts may spend all of their money on gambling or rack up massive debts as a result of their addiction.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can also have damaging effects on personal relationships. Addicts may neglect their partners or children in favour of gambling, and may become aggressive or violent when confronted about their problem. Relationships can also be damaged when one partner becomes obsessed with gambling while the other partner does not want anything to do with it.</p>
<p>In addition to the negative consequences for addicts and their families, gambling can also have harmful effects on society as a whole. Gambling can lead to crime and financial instability, both of which can have negative repercussions for communities.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. There are programs available that can help addicts recover from their addiction and rebuild their lives.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-costs-Americans-more-than-5-billion-each-year"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-costs-Americans-more-than-5-billion-each-year" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction costs Americans more than $5 billion each year"></a>Gambling addiction costs Americans more than $5 billion each year</h1><p>A recent study published by the University of Arizona has found that gambling addiction costs Americans more than $5 billion each year. This staggering figure accounts for both the negative consequences of problem gambling as well as the money spent on gambling-related activities.</p>
<p>The study, which is thought to be the first of its kind, surveyed more than 4,000 American adults about their gambling habits. It found that 2.6 percent of adults are pathological gamblers, meaning that they are unable to resist temptation and continue to gamble even when it causes them harm. Another 3.9 percent of adults are classified as problem gamblers, meaning that their gambling habits have led to negative consequences such as financial problems, job loss, and relationship issues.</p>
<p>Together, pathological and problem gamblers account for more than six percent of the adult population in the United States. This significant percentage has real-world consequences, with the study finding that pathological and problem gamblers cost society an estimated $5.4 billion each year. This breaks down to $2.5 billion in crime-related costs, $1.4 billion in health care costs, and $1.5 billion in lost productivity.</p>
<p>The study also found that men are more likely than women to become pathological or problem gamblers, and that those who live in states with lotteries are at greater risk for developing a gambling addiction. Among those who gamble regularly, African Americans are more likely than whites to develop a problem gambler, while Hispanics are less likely to do so.</p>
<p>The findings of this study should serve as a wake-up call to policymakers and the public at large about the seriousness of gambling addiction. With over 6 percent of adults affected by this serious issue, it is clear that more must be done to prevent and treat gambling addiction.</p>

<p>The amount wagered was down from the $21.7 million bet in Week 1, but still well above the $10.7 million wagered on NFL games in Week 2 of 2018.</p>
<p>The Giants’ 38-31 loss to the Cowboys accounted for the largest wager of the week at $1.3 million, with six other bets topping $500,000.</p>
<p>The Jets’ 17-16 win over the Browns had the smallest bet of the week at $25.</p>
<p>The Patriots’ 43-0 win over the Dolphins drew more than twice as much action as any other game, with $3 million wagered on that contest. The Giants-Cowboys and Chargers-Colts games were next, both drawing just over $1 million in bets.</p>
<p>New Jersey sportsbooks have now taken in more than $34 million in bets on NFL games this season.</p>
<h1 id="How-NFL-gambling-is-making-casinos-a-fortune"><a href="#How-NFL-gambling-is-making-casinos-a-fortune" class="headerlink" title="How NFL gambling is making casinos a fortune"></a>How NFL gambling is making casinos a fortune</h1><p>The NFL is one of the most popular sports in America, and with its popularity comes gambling. Bettors can make money in a lot of different ways when it comes to the NFL, but the most popular method is by betting on the games themselves.</p>
<p>This week, the New Orleans Saints are playing the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons are 3 point favorites in this game, which means that if you bet on them to win, they would have to win by at least 4 points for you to win your bet. If you think that the Saints will beat the Falcons, you would bet on them and hope that they win or lose by fewer than 3 points.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of different betting options available when it comes to NFL games. You can bet on who will win the game, who will score first, how many points each team will score, and a whole host of other things. This makes NFL gambling a very lucrative business for casinos.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind when betting on NFL games is that the odds are not always in favor of the favorite. In fact, there have been plenty of times where the underdog has won outright. This is one of the reasons why it’s important to do your research before placing a bet.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to make some money during this year’s NFL season, then casino gambling is definitely the way to go. There are plenty of different ways to make money, and with so much action taking place each week, there’s plenty of opportunity for profit. So don’t wait any longer – start gambling on NFL games today!</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-casions-take-in-over-27-million-on-NFL-betting-in-Week-1"><a href="#Nevada-casions-take-in-over-27-million-on-NFL-betting-in-Week-1" class="headerlink" title="Nevada casions take in over $27 million on NFL betting in Week 1"></a>Nevada casions take in over $27 million on NFL betting in Week 1</h1><p>According to a report from the Nevada Gaming Control Board, Nevada casinos took in over $27 million on NFL betting in Week 1.</p>
<p>The total amount wagered was $132,948,744, with the casinos taking in a total of $27,023,797 in winnings. The Rams-Raiders game was the most popular game for bettors, with over $10 million wagered on the matchup.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles were by far the most popular team for bettors, with over $19 million wagered on them across all games. The Patriots were a close second, with almost $18 million wagered on them.</p>
<p>The biggest upset of the week was the Jacksonville Jaguars knocking off the New England Patriots, with the Jaguars being one of the least popular teams to bet on.</p>
<h1 id="American-Gaming-Association-projects-6-billion-will-be-wagered-on-NFL-games-this-season"><a href="#American-Gaming-Association-projects-6-billion-will-be-wagered-on-NFL-games-this-season" class="headerlink" title="American Gaming Association projects $6 billion will be wagered on NFL games this season"></a>American Gaming Association projects $6 billion will be wagered on NFL games this season</h1><p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) projects that fans will wager $6 billion on NFL games during the 2017-2018 season.</p>
<p>This is the first time that the AGA has released such figures, and the news comes as no surprise to those in the gaming industry. In fact, authorized Nevada sports books have already taken in over $100 million in bets on NFL games since Labor Day.</p>
<p>“The popularity of football betting is astronomical and shows no signs of slowing down,” said Sara Slane, a senior vice president at the American Gaming Association. “Fans love to bet on all aspects of the game, from who will win the Super Bowl to how many yards a superstar receiver will get.”</p>
<p>Nevada sports books have long been considered a bellwether for gambling trends in the United States, and it’s clear that interest in wagering on NFL games is growing rapidly. In addition to traditional bets on the outcome of games, fans are now also placing increasingly large sums of money on proposition bets (also known as prop bets), which can include anything from whether or not there will be a safety scored in a particular game to whether or not New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady will break the single-season touchdown record.</p>
<p>It’s not just Americans who are getting in on the action; people all around the world are betting billions of dollars each year on NFL games. The global audience for American football is estimated to be around 1.5 billion people, and with so much money at stake, it’s no wonder that bookmakers are offering ever more enticing odds and making more lucrative profits.</p>
<p>As viewership of NFL games continues to grow, it’s likely that so too will interest in gambling on them. With billions of dollars up for grabs, bookmakers are sure to continue offering attractive betting options for football fans all over the world.</p>
<h1 id="Fans-risk-record-158-million-on-first-Sunday-of-NFL-season"><a href="#Fans-risk-record-158-million-on-first-Sunday-of-NFL-season" class="headerlink" title="Fans risk record $158 million on first Sunday of NFL season"></a>Fans risk record $158 million on first Sunday of NFL season</h1><p>The National Football League kicked off its 96th season on Thursday night with the Green Bay Packers prevailing over the Chicago Bears. The NFL’s popularity is underscored by the fact that fans wagered a record $158 million on the first Sunday of the season. That’s up from the previous high of $149 million set just last year.</p>
<p>Some of that money was wagered at sports books in Nevada, but most was placed illegally with offshore sportsbooks. The NFL and its team owners are notoriously anti-gambling, but they can only do so much to prevent it since gambling is legal in most other countries.</p>
<p>In addition to the record amount wagered, there was also a record amount of money lost. In total, bettors lost $105 million on Sunday, compared to $92 million last year. That’s a 12% increase in losses, which is largely due to all of the parity in the league these days. There are no dominant teams like there were a decade ago and as a result, there is more money being wagered on games each week.</p>
<p>The NFL has been able to parlay its popularity into massive television contracts. The league will earn $7.3 billion from television contracts this year, making it easily the most popular sport in America. And that number is only going to go up in upcoming years as Fox, CBS, ESPN and NBC all have agreed to pay even more for the rights to air NFL games.</p>
<p>All of that money is great for the league and its team owners, but it does come with some risks. The biggest risk is that players might get injured and then be unable to play anymore. That’s what happened back in 2011 when former New Orleans Saints player Kurt Warner decided to retire after getting injured in a preseason game. His departure left the Saints with few quarterbacks and led to them struggling early in the season.</p>
<p>The NFL has done a good job of managing those risks by instituting a salary cap so teams can’t spend too much on players. They’ve also shortened the preseason so players don’t get as many injuries. But there is always some risk involved, and that’s why the bets keep flowing in each week despite those risks.</p>

This means that Arizonans can now enjoy all the thrills and excitement of online casinos without having to leave their homes.</p>
<p>There are a number of great online casinos that are now open to Arizona residents, including Casino Arizona, Wild Wild West, and Lincoln Casino. All of these casinos offer a wide variety of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker. They also offer generous bonuses and rewards programs that can help you earn free casino chips and other perks.</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of the new Arizona gambling law, you must be at least 21 years old and reside in the state. You must also be physically located in Arizona when you are playing at an online casino. Gambling is prohibited in some parts of the state, so be sure to check the website of the casino you are interested in before signing up.</p>
<p>Online gambling can be a lot of fun, but it’s important to remember that it is also a form of entertainment that should be enjoyed responsibly. Don’t spend more than you can afford to lose, and make sure you are aware of the risks involved. If you have any questions or concerns about online gambling, consult with an experienced lawyer or financial advisor.</p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Becomes-the-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Arizona-Becomes-the-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Becomes the Latest State to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>Arizona Becomes the Latest State to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>The Great State of Arizona has enamored itself to the world of iGaming by legalizing it this week.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, lawmakers in Arizona overwhelmingly approved a new bill that legalizes online poker, casino games, and sports betting within the state. The bill had been in the works for months, but it gained some new urgency when Governor Doug Ducey said he would sign it into law.</p>
<p>Ducey’s decision bodes well for the industry as a whole because it could set a precedent for other states looking to legalize iGaming. So far, only Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware have legalized online gambling in its entirety, but others are mulling over similar legislation.</p>
<p>The passage of this bill is also good news for Arizonans because it will allow them to enjoy their favorite casino games from the comfort of their own homes. They will also be able to bet on sports without having to go to a physical location.</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy about the bill’s passage, however. The powerful casino lobby has come out against it, arguing that it will cannibalize their business. They are concerned that people will gamble less at brick-and-mortar casinos once they can do so online.</p>
<p>But supporters of the bill say that is not likely to happen because most people prefer to gamble in person. In any case, the industry will soon find out how much impact online gambling has on its business.</p>
<h1 id="Arizonans-Can-Now-Enjoy-Legalized-and-Regulated-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Arizonans-Can-Now-Enjoy-Legalized-and-Regulated-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Arizonans Can Now Enjoy Legalized and Regulated Online Gambling"></a>Arizonans Can Now Enjoy Legalized and Regulated Online Gambling</h1><p>In November of last year, Proposition 205 - the Arizona Marijuana Legalization Initiative - was passed by Arizona voters, legalizing recreational marijuana in the state. On April 14th of this year, Governor Doug Ducey signed into law Senate Bill 1098, which allows for and regulates online gambling within the state. This move makes Arizona the fourth US state to legalize online gambling, following Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware.</p>
<p>While SB 1098 does not allow residents to gamble on sports (a prohibition that is currently in place at the federal level), it does allow for a number of other types of online gambling, including poker, blackjack, and slots. The bill establishes a regulatory framework for online gambling providers in the state, requires them to pay a license fee and taxes on their income, and bars those under the age of 21 from playing. It also prohibits gambling websites from operating within Arizona unless they have been licensed by the state.</p>
<p>Supporters of SB 1098 argue that it will help create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state budget. They note that regulated online gambling is already taking place in Arizona anyway, with many Arizonans using offshore sites that are not subject to any regulation or oversight. Regulating and taxing these activities, they say, will help protect consumers while also generating revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of SB 1098 argue that it will lead to more problem gambling and addiction problems in the state. They note that many people who gamble online tend to do so compulsively, and that allowing these activities to take place within Arizona will only increase these risks.</p>

<p>Governor Doug Ducey signed the bill into law on Wednesday, October 17, 2018. The measure allows for a variety of online gambling activities, including online poker, blackjack, and slots.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear when exactly the new law will take effect. The specific regulations will be developed by the Arizona Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>Arizona becomes the fourth state to legalize online gambling, following New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada.</p>

This ruling overturned a prior decision made in 2013, which determined that Internet gambling was illegal in Arizona.</p>
<p>The 2013 decision was based on a law that prohibited gambling in all forms except for those that took place in casinos or racetracks. However, the court ruled that this law did not apply to gambling that occurred online, since it was not possible to enforce such a prohibition.</p>
<p>Monday’s ruling is considered a victory for the casino industry, as well as for companies that offer online gambling services. It is also likely to be welcomed by Arizonans who enjoy gambling and had been doing so illegally since the 2013 decision.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling had argued that it is addictive and can lead to financial ruin. However, the justices did not find this to be persuasive enough reason to prohibit it.</p>
