		<h1 id="Rams-Wrong-Means-Slot-Machine-Malfunction"><a href="#Rams-Wrong-Means-Slot-Machine-Malfunction" class="headerlink" title="Rams Wrong Means Slot Machine Malfunction!"></a>Rams Wrong Means Slot Machine Malfunction!</h1><p>Slot machines, also known as one-armed bandits, are a popular form of gambling. They are found in casinos and other places that offer gambling, such as racetracks. Slot machines have been around in some form since the late 1800s.</p>
<p>A slot machine works by a person putting money into the machine and then pushing a button or pulling a lever to spin the reels. The reels have symbols on them, and if the symbols match up when the reels stop spinning, the person wins money.</p>
<p>Sometimes slot machines malfunction, which can result in people winning or losing money unfairly. This happened in December 2017 at the Commerce Casino in Los Angeles when several Rams players were playing blackjack and roulette at the casino. Suddenly, the slot machines near their blackjack and roulette tables began spewing out money!</p>
<h1 id="Rams-Wrong-Slot-Machine-Glitch-Leads-to-Winning-Jackpot"><a href="#Rams-Wrong-Slot-Machine-Glitch-Leads-to-Winning-Jackpot" class="headerlink" title="Rams Wrong Slot Machine Glitch Leads to Winning Jackpot!"></a>Rams Wrong Slot Machine Glitch Leads to Winning Jackpot!</h1><p>Thursday, slot player Calvin Rams hit the jackpot at the Hollywood Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana after his machine apparently malfunctioned.</p>
<p>Rams was playing one of the machines on the casino’s second floor when he claims that the machine began to play by itself, spinning and betting on its own for about five minutes. Eventually, the machine stopped on a $100 jackpot. </p>
<p>“I never hit anything like that before,” said Rams. “It was pretty exciting.”</p>
<p>The casino has since looked into the incident and determined that there was in fact no malfunction with the machine; it simply erroneously credited Rams with the winnings. Officials believe that Rams may have inadvertently hit some buttons on the machine that caused it to start playing on its own.</p>
<p>While such an event may seem like a stroke of luck, or even fate, for Rams, it’s actually just another example of how technology can go wrong. Slot machines are programmed to payout certain odds based on the symbols that appear on the screen; if something goes wrong with the programming or software, as appears to be the case here, players can unexpectedly find themselves winning big payouts. </p>
<p>So if you’re ever feeling lucky at a casino and notice that your machine is acting oddly, don’t be too quick to celebrate - it might just be glitch that’s about to make you rich!</p>
<h1 id="Rams-Wrong-Vegas-Casino-Annoyance"><a href="#Rams-Wrong-Vegas-Casino-Annoyance" class="headerlink" title="Rams Wrong = Vegas Casino Annoyance"></a>Rams Wrong = Vegas Casino Annoyance</h1><p>In the NFL, one team Los Angeles Rams appears to be a thorn in the side of Las Vegas casinos. Against the point spread in seven out of their last eight games, the Rams have cost Sin City millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The Rams were four-point underdogs in Week 10 against New Orleans, but won outright handily 26-17 as Saints quarterback Drew Brees threw two interceptions. According to one sportsbook, that game resulted in a $1 million loss for Las Vegas casinos.</p>
<p>Las Vegas casinos are not happy with the upstart Rams. “We’re rooting for them to lose every game from now on,” said Todd Fuhrman, vice president of race and sports at Station Casinos told ESPN. “It’s been a rough few weeks.”</p>
<p>Rams linebacker Alec Ogletree was seemingly amused by the casino’s consternation. “I love it,” Ogletree said. “If they’re not happy with us, then we’re doing our job.”</p>
<p>The Rams are only 3-5 against the spread this season, but they have been a major headache for Las Vegas casinos nonetheless. In Week 9, they were three-point underdogs against Houston but pulled off the upset by winning 33-7. That game resulted in a $1.5 million loss for casinos.</p>
<p>In Week 4, the Rams were four-point underdogs against Dallas but lost by only four points, resulting in a $600,000 loss for Las Vegas casinos. And in Week 2, they were six-point underdogs against Washington but won outright 27-20. That cost Las Vegas casinos $1 million.</p>
<p>Rams cornerback Marcus Peters is quite pleased with himself that his team has been giving Las Vegas casinos such fits. “I love it,” Peters said. “It just makes me go harder and play better.”</p>
<p>So far this season, NFL bettors have lost nearly $10 million on games involving the Rams against the point spread.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Players-Beware-Rams-Wrong-Could-Cost-You"><a href="#Slot-Players-Beware-Rams-Wrong-Could-Cost-You" class="headerlink" title="Slot Players Beware: Rams Wrong Could Cost You!"></a>Slot Players Beware: Rams Wrong Could Cost You!</h1><p>In the NFL, there are player matchups that are more important than others. The Los Angeles Rams have an important one this week as they travel to play the Minnesota Vikings. The Rams have arguably the best defensive player in the league in Aaron Donald, but he will be going up against one of the best offensive lineman in the game in Andrew Whitworth.</p>
<p>Whitworth is a twelve-year veteran who has made the Pro Bowl four times and been selected to the First-Team All Pro twice. He is a large man at six-foot-seven and 335 pounds, which means he will be able to matchup well with Donald. This is a matchup that Rams fans should be worried about because Donald has been very disruptive this season.</p>
<p>He already has nine sacks, three forced fumbles, and two fumble recoveries. In addition, he has also recorded 29 tackles, four tackles for loss, and one pass defensed. If he is able to get pressure on Jared Goff, it could spell disaster for the Rams offense. Whitworth is definitely up for the challenge, and he knows that it will be a physical battle against Donald.</p>
<p>“I’ve played against him before; he’s a dominant player,” Whitworth said of Donald. “He’s everything you hear about and then some. He really is amazing how disruptive he can be. We’re going to have to do a good job as an offensive line of preparing for him and trying to give our quarterback time.”</p>
<p>The Rams may have to adjust their game plan if they want to win this game against the Vikings. They may need to run the ball more than they would like to since Whitworth should be able to handle Donald by himself most of the time. They cannot rely on Goff to win this game with his arm alone because that could be a recipe for disaster.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-Rams-Error-on-Slot-Machines-Ruining-Your-Fun"><a href="#Is-the-Rams-Error-on-Slot-Machines-Ruining-Your-Fun" class="headerlink" title="Is the Rams Error on Slot Machines Ruining Your Fun?"></a>Is the Rams Error on Slot Machines Ruining Your Fun?</h1><p>Slot machines are one of the most commonly found games in casinos, and for good reason – they’re easy to play and offer the potential for big payouts. But what if those big payouts come at a cost? What if casinos use slot machines to take advantage of players, especially those who aren’t as familiar with how they work?</p>
<p>The Rams error on slot machines might be doing just that. Slot machines are designed to create an illusion of control. Players see themselves hitting small wins over and over again, and this encourages them to keep playing. In reality, these small wins are just a way to keep players engaged, and the odds of winning big are actually quite low.</p>
<p>So why would casinos do this? The answer is simple – because it works! Slot machines bring in more money for casinos than any other game. In fact, they account for almost 70% of all casino revenue. So while you might think you’re just having some harmless fun, the Rams error on slot machines may be taking your money without you even realizing it.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid being taken advantage of by casinos, then be sure to educate yourself on the Rams error on slot machines. Learn about how they work and how to spot when casinos are using them to take your money. Most importantly, know your limits and don’t let yourself get sucked in by the lure of those big payouts.</p>
