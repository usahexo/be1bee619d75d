	  <h1 id="Arizonans-Can-Now-Legally-Gamble-at-Online-Casinos"><a href="#Arizonans-Can-Now-Legally-Gamble-at-Online-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Arizonans Can Now Legally Gamble at Online Casinos"></a>Arizonans Can Now Legally Gamble at Online Casinos</h1><p>The Grand Canyon State has a new law on the books that legalizes online gambling for its residents. This means that Arizonans can now enjoy all the thrills and excitement of online casinos without having to leave their homes.</p>
<p>There are a number of great online casinos that are now open to Arizona residents, including Casino Arizona, Wild Wild West, and Lincoln Casino. All of these casinos offer a wide variety of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker. They also offer generous bonuses and rewards programs that can help you earn free casino chips and other perks.</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of the new Arizona gambling law, you must be at least 21 years old and reside in the state. You must also be physically located in Arizona when you are playing at an online casino. Gambling is prohibited in some parts of the state, so be sure to check the website of the casino you are interested in before signing up.</p>
<p>Online gambling can be a lot of fun, but it’s important to remember that it is also a form of entertainment that should be enjoyed responsibly. Don’t spend more than you can afford to lose, and make sure you are aware of the risks involved. If you have any questions or concerns about online gambling, consult with an experienced lawyer or financial advisor.</p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Becomes-the-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Arizona-Becomes-the-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Becomes the Latest State to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>Arizona Becomes the Latest State to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>The Great State of Arizona has enamored itself to the world of iGaming by legalizing it this week.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, lawmakers in Arizona overwhelmingly approved a new bill that legalizes online poker, casino games, and sports betting within the state. The bill had been in the works for months, but it gained some new urgency when Governor Doug Ducey said he would sign it into law.</p>
<p>Ducey’s decision bodes well for the industry as a whole because it could set a precedent for other states looking to legalize iGaming. So far, only Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware have legalized online gambling in its entirety, but others are mulling over similar legislation.</p>
<p>The passage of this bill is also good news for Arizonans because it will allow them to enjoy their favorite casino games from the comfort of their own homes. They will also be able to bet on sports without having to go to a physical location.</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy about the bill’s passage, however. The powerful casino lobby has come out against it, arguing that it will cannibalize their business. They are concerned that people will gamble less at brick-and-mortar casinos once they can do so online.</p>
<p>But supporters of the bill say that is not likely to happen because most people prefer to gamble in person. In any case, the industry will soon find out how much impact online gambling has on its business.</p>
<h1 id="Arizonans-Can-Now-Enjoy-Legalized-and-Regulated-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Arizonans-Can-Now-Enjoy-Legalized-and-Regulated-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Arizonans Can Now Enjoy Legalized and Regulated Online Gambling"></a>Arizonans Can Now Enjoy Legalized and Regulated Online Gambling</h1><p>In November of last year, Proposition 205 - the Arizona Marijuana Legalization Initiative - was passed by Arizona voters, legalizing recreational marijuana in the state. On April 14th of this year, Governor Doug Ducey signed into law Senate Bill 1098, which allows for and regulates online gambling within the state. This move makes Arizona the fourth US state to legalize online gambling, following Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware.</p>
<p>While SB 1098 does not allow residents to gamble on sports (a prohibition that is currently in place at the federal level), it does allow for a number of other types of online gambling, including poker, blackjack, and slots. The bill establishes a regulatory framework for online gambling providers in the state, requires them to pay a license fee and taxes on their income, and bars those under the age of 21 from playing. It also prohibits gambling websites from operating within Arizona unless they have been licensed by the state.</p>
<p>Supporters of SB 1098 argue that it will help create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state budget. They note that regulated online gambling is already taking place in Arizona anyway, with many Arizonans using offshore sites that are not subject to any regulation or oversight. Regulating and taxing these activities, they say, will help protect consumers while also generating revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of SB 1098 argue that it will lead to more problem gambling and addiction problems in the state. They note that many people who gamble online tend to do so compulsively, and that allowing these activities to take place within Arizona will only increase these risks.</p>
<h1 id="State-of-Arizona-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#State-of-Arizona-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="State of Arizona legalizes online gambling"></a>State of Arizona legalizes online gambling</h1><p>The State of Arizona has legalized online gambling, making it the fourth state in the US to do so.</p>
<p>Governor Doug Ducey signed the bill into law on Wednesday, October 17, 2018. The measure allows for a variety of online gambling activities, including online poker, blackjack, and slots.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear when exactly the new law will take effect. The specific regulations will be developed by the Arizona Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>Arizona becomes the fourth state to legalize online gambling, following New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada.</p>
<h1 id="Arizonans-Can-Now-Gamble-on-the-Internet-Without-Breaking-the-Law"><a href="#Arizonans-Can-Now-Gamble-on-the-Internet-Without-Breaking-the-Law" class="headerlink" title="Arizonans Can Now Gamble on the Internet Without Breaking the Law"></a>Arizonans Can Now Gamble on the Internet Without Breaking the Law</h1><p>In a unanimous decision on Monday, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that Arizonans can now legally gamble online. This ruling overturned a prior decision made in 2013, which determined that Internet gambling was illegal in Arizona.</p>
<p>The 2013 decision was based on a law that prohibited gambling in all forms except for those that took place in casinos or racetracks. However, the court ruled that this law did not apply to gambling that occurred online, since it was not possible to enforce such a prohibition.</p>
<p>Monday’s ruling is considered a victory for the casino industry, as well as for companies that offer online gambling services. It is also likely to be welcomed by Arizonans who enjoy gambling and had been doing so illegally since the 2013 decision.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling had argued that it is addictive and can lead to financial ruin. However, the justices did not find this to be persuasive enough reason to prohibit it.</p>
