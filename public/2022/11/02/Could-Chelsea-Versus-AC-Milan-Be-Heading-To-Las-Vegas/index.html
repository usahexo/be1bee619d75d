	  <h1 id="Could-Chelsea-Versus-AC-Milan-Be-Heading-To-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Could-Chelsea-Versus-AC-Milan-Be-Heading-To-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Could Chelsea Versus AC Milan Be Heading To Las Vegas?"></a>Could Chelsea Versus AC Milan Be Heading To Las Vegas?</h1><p>There’s been plenty of speculation in the last few weeks about where the AC Milan versus Chelsea friendly match will be played. The two teams are set to meet on July 29th, and while both Stamford Bridge and the San Siro have been mentioned as potential venues, a new potential location has surfaced: Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The news comes from Italian outlet Calcio Mercato, which claims that Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is keen on taking the game to Sin City. The reasoning behind it is said to be twofold: Abramovich is apparently looking for new ways to increase revenue and promote the club, and he also wants to strengthen relations with Russian business partners who have ties to Vegas.</p>
<p>If the match does end up being played in Vegas, it would be a huge coup for the city. Not only would it be a high-profile event, but it would also bring in a lot of tourism revenue. It would also be another feather in the cap for Las Vegas’s burgeoning sports scene, which already includes NHL and NFL games as well as major boxing matches.</p>
<p>Even if everything falls into place and Chelsea Versus AC Milan is played in Las Vegas, there’s still no guarantee that it will be a sell-out. However, with just three weeks until kickoff, tickets are sure to start selling fast so anyone interested in attending had better act quickly.</p>
<h1 id="Chelsea-Could-Play-In-A-Pre-Season-Game-In-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Chelsea-Could-Play-In-A-Pre-Season-Game-In-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Chelsea Could Play In A Pre-Season Game In Las Vegas"></a>Chelsea Could Play In A Pre-Season Game In Las Vegas</h1><p>Chelsea are considering a move to play in a pre-season game in Las Vegas this summer, as Maurizio Sarri looks to get his side ready for the new season.</p>
<p>The Blues are thought to be one of a number of clubs looking at playing in the city, as they bid to take advantage of the growing interest in football in America.</p>
<p>Las Vegas is seen as an attractive destination for top teams due to the high level of interest in the game, as well as the opportunity to make money from lucrative sponsorship deals and other commercial opportunities.</p>
<p>Sarri is thought to be keen on the idea of taking his side to America for some warm-up matches ahead of the new campaign, and Chelsea are thought to be close to finalising a deal to play in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>This would be a major coup for the city, which is looking to further establish itself as a major centre for sport in America.</p>
<h1 id="Chelsea-Could-Face-AC-Milan-In-A-Prestigious-Game-In-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Chelsea-Could-Face-AC-Milan-In-A-Prestigious-Game-In-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Chelsea Could Face AC Milan In A Prestigious Game In Las Vegas"></a>Chelsea Could Face AC Milan In A Prestigious Game In Las Vegas</h1><p>After a long and successful season in the English Premier League, Chelsea are set to embark on a preseason tour of the United States. They are scheduled to play three games, against Liverpool, Barcelona and AC Milan.</p>
<p>While the game against Liverpool is sure to be a fiery encounter, it is the game against AC Milan that is generating the most excitement. This is because it could be an opportunity for Chelsea to face their former manager, Antonio Conte.</p>
<p>Conte enjoyed great success at Chelsea, winning the Premier League in his first season in charge. However, he was sacked at the start of this season after a poor run of results. Since then, he has taken over as manager of AC Milan.</p>
<p>The two sides have not met since February 2017, when Chelsea ran out 5-1 winners in the Premier League. However, with Conte now in charge of AC Milan, there is sure to be plenty of interest in this game.</p>
<p>If both clubs reach the final of the International Champions Cup (ICC), which is organized by Relevent Sports, then the game will take place in Las Vegas. This would be a major coup for Relevent Sports, as it would be one of the biggest games ever played in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>With Chelsea and AC Milan both possessing strong squads, this could be an exciting encounter between two of Europe’s top clubs.</p>
<h1 id="Could-An-International-Showdown-Between-Chelsea-And-AC-Milan-Happen-In-Sin-City"><a href="#Could-An-International-Showdown-Between-Chelsea-And-AC-Milan-Happen-In-Sin-City" class="headerlink" title="Could An International Showdown Between Chelsea And AC Milan Happen In Sin City?"></a>Could An International Showdown Between Chelsea And AC Milan Happen In Sin City?</h1><p>There is no question that Milan are a club on the rise, but they may have to turn their attention to the Premier League if they want to get their hands on Eden Hazard.</p>
<p>AC Milan are unlikely to let the Belgian slip through their fingers and will be willing to offer Chelsea a substantial fee for his services. The Blues would not be keen on selling one of their prized assets, but a move to the San Siro could appeal to Hazard.</p>
<p>He has already been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge and Antonio Conte’s departure could persuade him to join forces with Gennaro Gattuso. The Rossoneri are in the hunt for a new striker and Chelsea may be willing to cash in if they can sign Gonzalo Higuain.</p>
<p>The Argentine has been in fine form this season and Milan will hope that he can fire them back into contention for Champions League football next season.</p>
<h1 id="Chelsea-FC-Could-Play-AC-Milan-At-The-Venetian-Casino-In-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Chelsea-FC-Could-Play-AC-Milan-At-The-Venetian-Casino-In-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Chelsea FC Could Play AC Milan At The Venetian Casino In Las Vegas"></a>Chelsea FC Could Play AC Milan At The Venetian Casino In Las Vegas</h1><p>Chelsea FC are considering a move to play their pre-season friendly games in the United States this summer.</p>
<p>The Blues are thought to be keen on playing two fixtures in America, and are said to be in talks with both the Venetian Casino in Las Vegas and the Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara.</p>
<p>If they were to finalise a deal to play at the Venetian Casino, it would see Italian giants AC Milan come over to face them as part of their pre-season preparations.</p>
<p>The game at the casino would come just days after Chelsea’s fixture against Liverpool in Pasadena, which is currently scheduled for July 28th.</p>
<p>It is not yet known if Chelsea have any other fixtures planned for their pre-season tour of the States, but it is understood that they are keen on making a trip across the Atlantic. </p>
<p>Maurizio Sarri’s side will hope to get some much-needed game time under their belts before heading into what looks set to be another competitive Premier League season.</p>
