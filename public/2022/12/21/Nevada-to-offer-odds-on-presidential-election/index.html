	  <h1 id="Nevada-to-offer-odds-on-presidential-election"><a href="#Nevada-to-offer-odds-on-presidential-election" class="headerlink" title="Nevada to offer odds on presidential election"></a>Nevada to offer odds on presidential election</h1><p>The state of Nevada will be the first to offer bets on the outcome of the presidential election. This is in direct response to a recent Supreme Court ruling that overturned a federal law banning sports betting. State officials say that they will have odds on who will win each state, as well as who will win the Electoral College.</p>
<p>Many people are skeptical about this move, saying that it opens the door for corruption. But state officials maintain that the process will be closely monitored, and that any wrongdoing will be dealt with swiftly.</p>
<p>This is a major change for America, and it will be interesting to see how it plays out. Will people be able to resist the temptation to bet on politics? Only time will tell.</p>
<h1 id="McGregor-and-Mayweather-agree-to-50-50-split-in-betting"><a href="#McGregor-and-Mayweather-agree-to-50-50-split-in-betting" class="headerlink" title="McGregor and Mayweather agree to 50-50 split in betting"></a>McGregor and Mayweather agree to 50-50 split in betting</h1><p>In an unprecedented move that is set to shatter box office records, both Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather have agreed to a 50-50 split in betting.</p>
<p>The move comes as a result of the intense public interest in the fight, which is now expected to break all previous box office records. With bets evenly split, both fighters are predicted to win almost the same amount of money.</p>
<p>“This is great news for the fans,” said UFC president Dana White. “It means that everyone has a chance of winning, and that’s what makes this fight so exciting.”</p>
<p>Mayweather has been widely tipped to win the fight, but McGregor is considered by many to be a serious threat. Odds for the fight are currently at 1/4 for Mayweather and 5/1 for McGregor.</p>
<p>With bets coming in from all over the world, it is shaping up to be one of the most lucrative fights in history.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-Finals-Odds-Warriors-open-as-8-5-point-favorites-over-Cavs"><a href="#NBA-Finals-Odds-Warriors-open-as-8-5-point-favorites-over-Cavs" class="headerlink" title="NBA Finals Odds: Warriors open as 8.5-point favorites over Cavs"></a>NBA Finals Odds: Warriors open as 8.5-point favorites over Cavs</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors will open as 8.5-point favorites over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals, according to sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.</p>
<p>The Warriors completed a sweep of the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday to advance to their third straight NBA Finals appearance and fourth in five years, while the Cavaliers needed seven games to dispatch of the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>
<p>Golden State has been installed as a favorite in each of its past three meetings with Cleveland, including a 3.5-point spread in favor of the Warriors when they met in last year’s NBA Finals. The Cavs were able to pull off the upset as an underdog in that series, but oddsmakers are not giving them much of a chance this time around.</p>
<p>The Warriors opened as 11-point favorites in Game 1 of the NBA Finals before dropping down to 8.5 points following news that Kevin Durant would be out for at least Game 1 with a calf injury. Durant is expected to miss at least the first two games of the series, but his status for later games is still up in the air.</p>
<p>Both teams had relatively easy paths to the NBA Finals, with Golden State going 12-0 in the playoffs and Cleveland going 12-1. However, sportsbooks believe that the Warriors are still head and shoulders above everyone else in the league, as evidenced by their significant odds-on favorite designation for this year’s NBA Finals.</p>
<h1 id="Liverpool-one-of-the-early-favorites-to-win-the-Premier-League-title"><a href="#Liverpool-one-of-the-early-favorites-to-win-the-Premier-League-title" class="headerlink" title="Liverpool one of the early favorites to win the Premier League title"></a>Liverpool one of the early favorites to win the Premier League title</h1><p>Liverpool is one of the early favorites to win the Premier League title this season. The Reds have made some significant additions in the offseason, including goalkeeper Alisson and midfielder Naby Keita.</p>
<p>Liverpool finished fourth in the Premier League last season, but they should be much better this year with the addition of Keita and Allison. The Reds also have a very favorable schedule to start the season, which should help them get off to a good start.</p>
<p>Jurgen Klopp’s team is loaded with talent, and they are poised to make a run at the Premier League title this season. Liverpool is my pick to win the Premier League this year.</p>
<h1 id="Alabama-Crimson-Tide-a-big-favorite-to-win-college-football-national-championship"><a href="#Alabama-Crimson-Tide-a-big-favorite-to-win-college-football-national-championship" class="headerlink" title="Alabama Crimson Tide a big favorite to win college football national championship"></a>Alabama Crimson Tide a big favorite to win college football national championship</h1><p>Alabama is the big favorite to win the college football national championship, according to the latest odds from Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The Crimson Tide are currently at 6-1 odds, while Clemson is second at 7-1. Oklahoma is third at 8-1, followed by Georgia and Ohio State at 10-1.</p>
<p>Alabama has been dominant in college football over the past few years, winning the national championship in 2016, 2017 and 2018. The Crimson Tide are led by head coach Nick Saban,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> who has won six national championships (four with Alabama).</p>
<p>Saban is known for his intense coaching style and his ability to get the most out of his players. Alabama also has a number of talented players on its roster, including quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and running back Najee Harris.</p>
<p>Clemson is also a very good team, and it will be looking to win its first national championship since 1981. The Tigers are led by head coach Dabo Swinney, who has compiled a record of 108-30 during his tenure at Clemson.</p>
<p>The Tigers have a number of talented players on their roster, including quarterback Trevor Lawrence and defensive lineman Christian Wilkins. Oklahoma is another team that could make a run at the national championship this year. The Sooners are led by head coach Lincoln Riley, who is in his second year as the head coach at Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Riley led the Sooners to a victory in the Sugar Bowl last year and he looks poised to lead them to even greater success this year. Georgia and Ohio State are also two teams that should not be taken lightly this season.</p>
